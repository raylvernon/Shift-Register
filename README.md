# Shift-Register

This program is a tool to solve Linear Feedback Shift Registers, a type of question found in Discrete Mathematics. In a shift register the variables are defined as a0,a1,...,aN (max 11). The number total of variables and the locations of the shifters are taken as input and the output prints out each shift that was made before reaching the final shift. Each variable name is represented as a string, ie variable a0 is represented as "z" and a1 is represented as "o".
